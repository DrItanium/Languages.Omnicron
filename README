The Omnicron programming language is designed to simplify the construction of
GUI forms that are centered around extracting input from common control sets. 


It is a stack based langauge that greatly simplifies the act of form
construction and data acquisition. It also allows plugins to be located in
another application domain yet provide local GUI forms in the primary domain
without fear of copying libraries over to the current domain. 

Eventually, Omnicron will have a complete tool set which includes tools to
allow programmers to test their scripts before embedding them as strings in a
given program.
