This library contains structures used to store different types of data. 
I do not believe that these structures are fast or better than any other
implementation. They are simply what I created to solve problems during the
last four years.

This library depends on the Extensions library to work properly so you will
need to pull that down as well

As with the Extensions library, the Collections library is licensed under the
BSD license. I don't care what you do with it just follow the rules outlined by
the license.
